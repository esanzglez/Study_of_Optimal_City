# Study_of_Optimal_City
This is a research report for the course "Urban Informatics for Smart, Sustainable Cities" @NYU-CUSP

The work of Geoffrey West and others has established the potential existence of scaling across various urban functions and outcomes and population size. In addition to this work, there has been increasing interest in determining if there is an “optimal” city size and density. In other words, is there an ideal population size and density that will maximize the efficiencies of transportation systems, resource consumption, etc. and that will create the greatest outcomes in terms of quality of life metrics (safety, public health, economic equity, etc.)? 

This report aims to explore this question by conducting a crosssectional comparative analysis of U.S. cities with respect to carbon emissions. Climate change and sustainability are major challenges facing cities, and understanding possible relationships between city size and density and carbon emissions could reveal important lessons for city planning and design.
